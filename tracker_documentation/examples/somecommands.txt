# Updates to ingame cc system

- new term to memorize: "**timestring**"
> timestring = A term to describe my custom format many commands will begin to use. 

## A time string consists of:
1: how much  2:of what

- A time string can be any combination of, multiples of, omissions of:

	year/years
	month/months
	day/days
	hour/hours
	minutes/mins/min/minute
	second/secs/sec/second


Valid time string:   1 min 2 min 5 seconds

> This results in a produced time of three minutes, and five seconds. How this is used varies. 
> Many new cc commands are also flag based. This means they can be in any order, and must have valid flags with valid values such as `-r "verbally abusive"` for "*reason*".



# New Commands ( and alias ):

- **mute/gag** ( this is a textmute, voice will be explicitely voice_mute  )
[
> `cc mute r5mkos -1` permanent mute.  0 and -1 are universal flags and do not require a value. They can be used as values, even though they are flags like `-r` ( depends on context as well )
> 
> `cc mute r5mkos 2 min -r "Cool down for a few minutes"`
> The player will be muted, and set to auto unmute in 2 mins, even if the server crashes or the player leaves. The reason is saved to the player as well, and can be reviewed by other admins. The reason is shown to the player upon being muted, even if they joined after being muted.
> 
> It is possible to mute/unmute players who are not in the server and this takes effect immediately regardless of server state.
]

- **unmute/ungag**
[
> `cc unmute r5mkos 3 mins -r "I typed this 3 mins ago."`
> The player will be unmuted at a later time if a **timestring** is provided. This will work even for years. The reason will replace the muted reason however, so omit if the record should stand. Todo: ( show reason to player on unmute? )
]

- **is_muted/is_gagged**
[
> `cc is_muted r5mkos`
> Returns true/false.
}

- **mute_reason/gag_reason**
[
> `cc mute_reason r5mkos`
> Returns the stored reason set by muter.
]

- **unmute_time/ungag_time**
[
> `cc unmute_time r5mkos`
> Returns the amount of time in time string readable format until unmute.
]
